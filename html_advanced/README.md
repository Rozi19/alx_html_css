<p>The first question tell to put header in the body then in the <strong>header</strong> to use a block. To the block use <strong> div tag</strong>. which mean the second border is the header and the third border is the first div. Then in another block or the second div put linkable image for that we use a <strong>anchor (a) tag </strong> before closeing anchor tag use <strong>img tag </strong>for the image then close the anchor tag and close the second div. Open the third div or third block for our three links. For links we use <strong>anchor tag or a tag</strong>.Then close the third div, first div and header.</p>
